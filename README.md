# Summary of The Gaming Room client and their software requirements
Throughout the course we have worked on a project in which we work for a company called, Creative Technology Solutions (CTS). The Gaming Room is company that produces video games, and they have hired us to help transition their game, 'Draw It or Lose It', from an Android only app to a web-based game accessible from mutliple platforms. The game itself is based on the 1980s television game 'Win, Lose, or Draw'. Each game will have one or more teams, and each team will have multiple players.

One of the main programming requirements is that only one instance of game can exist in memory at any given time. Therefore, we designed the Game class using the singleton pattern. Furthermore, each Game, Team, and Player must have unique names. When creating a new game, new team, or new player, we included code to verify no duplicate names would exist. This process included the use of the Iterator pattern so that traversing our data structures was fast, and did not intrude on the underlying data.

We used Java as our primary programming language. Since the game is web-based, we also used the JaxRS API and Jersey API to facilitate the RESTful programming process. Since we were following RESTful design, it made sense to use the Client-Server architectural pattern.
